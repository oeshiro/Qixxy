# Qixxy

**Qixxy** is a Qix-clone game for PC. The goal is to claim as much playfield as you can (not less than a certain treshold depending on the difficulty) by flying around in your fancy spaceship and drawing lines and shapes, desperately trying to survive and defend your galaxy from merciless alien invaders. It is a new version of the classic arcade video game Qix, written completely in Scala with the LibGDX framework.

The app was written as a coursework in 2015, so it isn't maintained.
